# Implement ViT from scratch and train it on EuroSAT

In this notebook, first of all, I did EDA on EuroSAT, a dataset consisting of $10$ classes with $27,000$ labeled and geo-referenced samples. In the next part of this report, I implement ViT from scratch. Next, I trained this model for 20 epochs on mentioned dataset. Finaly, I evaluate this model on test dataset, and by using PCA and confusion matrix, I explained results.
