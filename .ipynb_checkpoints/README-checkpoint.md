## `report-2:` Exploratory Data Analysis - SQuADv2.0

In this report, I implemented notebook of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the SQuAD dataset, a question answering dataset, and also used predictions of my groupmate's model for this task to evaluate them with the baseline and human answers.

## `report-3:` Explorary Data Analysis - Flicker8k, MSCOCO-Captions, and VizWiz-Captions

I compared between three Image Captioning datasets, Flickr8k, MSCOCO-Captions, and VizWiz-Captions, in different terms.
Also, I evaluated Models implemented by my groupmates on Flickr8k and compared the results together.

## `report-4:` Implementing Different Data Augmentation Methods and Explorary Data Analysis on ImageNet

In this notebook, I did a simple EDA on ImageNet. In the next part of this report, I implement several data augmentation methods such as MixUp, CutMix, PCA, Image translation, and DeepAugmentation. Finaly, I evaluate three models: Baseline model which is ResNet-50, ResNet-50 + MixUp, and ResNet-50 + CutMix.
